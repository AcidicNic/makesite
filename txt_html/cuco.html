Smoking broken windows

[Chorus: CUCO]
I&#39;ve been tripping off the tabs in my room
I don&#39;t know why, baby, but I&#39;m feeling blue
Take another tab, an ounce of the shrooms
No, don&#39;t hit my line, babygirl, like, who are you?
I&#39;ve been tripping off the tabs in my room
I don&#39;t know why, baby, but I&#39;m feeling blue
Take another tab, an ounce of the shrooms
No, don&#39;t hit my line, babygirl, like, who are you?

[Verse 1: CUCO]
Oh no, don&#39;t hate just get up out my way
I&#39;ve been getting high like every single day
And I need some peace of mind
I don&#39;t know where to find
All the the answers to my questions, I&#39;m not satisfied
Where my mind is at, Hell is bound to find me
And if I find the light, that shit is gonna blind me
I&#39;ve been off it like a prophet, ain&#39;t no telling why
Lately, can you blame me for the fact that I just lost my mind?

[Chorus: CUCO]
I&#39;ve been tripping off the tabs in my room
I don&#39;t know why, baby, but I&#39;m feeling blue
Take another tab, an ounce of the shrooms
No, don&#39;t hit my line, babygirl, like, who are you?
I&#39;ve been tripping off the tabs in my room
I don&#39;t know why, baby, but I&#39;m feeling blue
Take another tab, an ounce of the shrooms
No, don&#39;t hit my line, babygirl, like, who are you?

[Bridge: CUCO]
And if you need me, then you know where to find me
I&#39;m feeling lost, I just need someone to guide me
Don&#39;t wanna feel left out
Please, understand me now
But If you can&#39;t, then it&#39;s alright, I&#39;ll always be around

[Refrain: Suscat0]
Smoking broken windows, playing my Nintendo
If you fuck with me, then I&#39;ll pull out my extendo
Smoking broken window, smoking broken window
Smoking broken window, smoking broken window
Smoking broken windows, playing my Nintendo
If you fuck with me, then I&#39;ll pull out my extendo
Smoking broken window, smoking broken window
Smoking broken window, smoking broken windows

[Chorus: CUCO]
I&#39;ve been tripping off the tabs in my room
I don&#39;t know why, baby, but I&#39;m feeling blue
Take another tab, an ounce of the shrooms
No, don&#39;t hit my line, babygirl, like, who are you?
I&#39;ve been tripping off the tabs in my room
I don&#39;t know why, baby, but I&#39;m feeling blue
Take another tab, an ounce of the shrooms
No, don&#39;t hit my line, babygirl, like, who are you?

[Refrain: Suscat0]
Smoking broken windows, playing my Nintendo
If you fuck with me, then I&#39;ll pull out my extendo
Smoking broken window, smoking broken window
Smoking broken window, smoking broken window
Smoking broken windows, playing my Nintendo
If you fuck with me, then I&#39;ll pull out my extendo
Smoking broken window, smoking broken window
Smoking broken window, smoking broken windows

[Chorus: CUCO]
I&#39;ve been tripping off the tabs in my room
I don&#39;t know why, baby, but I&#39;m feeling blue
Take another tab, an ounce of the shrooms
No, don&#39;t hit my line, babygirl, like, who are you?
I&#39;ve been tripping off the tabs in my room
I don&#39;t know why, baby, but I&#39;m feeling blue
Take another tab, an ounce of the shrooms
No, don&#39;t hit my line, babygirl, like, who are you?

[Outro: CUCO]
I&#39;ve been tripping off the tabs in my room
I don&#39;t know why, baby, but I&#39;m feeling blue
Take another tab, an ounce of the shrooms
No, don&#39;t hit my line, babygirl, like, who are you?
I&#39;ve been tripping off the tabs in my room
I don&#39;t know why, baby, but I&#39;m feeling blue
Take another tab, an ounce of the shrooms
No, don&#39;t hit my line, babygirl, like, who are you?</div>
