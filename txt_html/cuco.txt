Cuco Lyrics
[Intro]
Smoking broken windows

[Chorus: CUCO]
I've been tripping off the tabs in my room
I don't know why, baby, but I'm feeling blue
Take another tab, an ounce of the shrooms
No, don't hit my line, babygirl, like, who are you?
I've been tripping off the tabs in my room
I don't know why, baby, but I'm feeling blue
Take another tab, an ounce of the shrooms
No, don't hit my line, babygirl, like, who are you?

[Verse 1: CUCO]
Oh no, don't hate just get up out my way
I've been getting high like every single day
And I need some peace of mind
I don't know where to find
All the the answers to my questions, I'm not satisfied
Where my mind is at, Hell is bound to find me
And if I find the light, that shit is gonna blind me
I've been off it like a prophet, ain't no telling why
Lately, can you blame me for the fact that I just lost my mind?

[Chorus: CUCO]
I've been tripping off the tabs in my room
I don't know why, baby, but I'm feeling blue
Take another tab, an ounce of the shrooms
No, don't hit my line, babygirl, like, who are you?
I've been tripping off the tabs in my room
I don't know why, baby, but I'm feeling blue
Take another tab, an ounce of the shrooms
No, don't hit my line, babygirl, like, who are you?

[Bridge: CUCO]
And if you need me, then you know where to find me
I'm feeling lost, I just need someone to guide me
Don't wanna feel left out
Please, understand me now
But If you can't, then it's alright, I'll always be around

[Refrain: Suscat0]
Smoking broken windows, playing my Nintendo
If you fuck with me, then I'll pull out my extendo
Smoking broken window, smoking broken window
Smoking broken window, smoking broken window
Smoking broken windows, playing my Nintendo
If you fuck with me, then I'll pull out my extendo
Smoking broken window, smoking broken window
Smoking broken window, smoking broken windows

[Chorus: CUCO]
I've been tripping off the tabs in my room
I don't know why, baby, but I'm feeling blue
Take another tab, an ounce of the shrooms
No, don't hit my line, babygirl, like, who are you?
I've been tripping off the tabs in my room
I don't know why, baby, but I'm feeling blue
Take another tab, an ounce of the shrooms
No, don't hit my line, babygirl, like, who are you?

[Refrain: Suscat0]
Smoking broken windows, playing my Nintendo
If you fuck with me, then I'll pull out my extendo
Smoking broken window, smoking broken window
Smoking broken window, smoking broken window
Smoking broken windows, playing my Nintendo
If you fuck with me, then I'll pull out my extendo
Smoking broken window, smoking broken window
Smoking broken window, smoking broken windows

[Chorus: CUCO]
I've been tripping off the tabs in my room
I don't know why, baby, but I'm feeling blue
Take another tab, an ounce of the shrooms
No, don't hit my line, babygirl, like, who are you?
I've been tripping off the tabs in my room
I don't know why, baby, but I'm feeling blue
Take another tab, an ounce of the shrooms
No, don't hit my line, babygirl, like, who are you?

[Outro: CUCO]
I've been tripping off the tabs in my room
I don't know why, baby, but I'm feeling blue
Take another tab, an ounce of the shrooms
No, don't hit my line, babygirl, like, who are you?
I've been tripping off the tabs in my room
I don't know why, baby, but I'm feeling blue
Take another tab, an ounce of the shrooms
No, don't hit my line, babygirl, like, who are you?
